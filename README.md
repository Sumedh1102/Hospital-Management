# Hospital-Management
The Hospital Management System is a C-based application that manages patient and doctor records, allowing users to admit and discharge patients, add doctors, and store information in text files.


Here is the README.md for the Hospital Management System project without the # symbols:


# Features
	•	Admit patients with their details (name, address, disease, admission date).
	•	View the list of admitted patients.
	•	Discharge patients based on their ID.
	•	Add doctor details (name, address, specialization, joining date).
	•	View the list of doctors.

# How It Works
	1.	The program presents a menu with options to perform various actions like admitting a patient, viewing patient lists, discharging patients, adding a doctor, and viewing doctor lists.
	2.	The patient information is stored in a file (patient.txt), and doctor details are stored in another file (doctor.txt).
	3.	The user interacts with the system through simple menu-driven commands.

# Example Workflow
	1.	Admit Patient:
	•	The user enters patient details such as ID, name, address, disease, and admission date.
	•	The details are saved in the patient.txt file.
	2.	View Patient List:
	•	The program retrieves and displays the details of all admitted patients from the patient.txt file.
	3.	Discharge Patient:
	•	The user can discharge a patient by entering their ID.
	•	The system removes the discharged patient’s details from the patient.txt file.
	4.	Add Doctor:
	•	The user can enter doctor details such as ID, name, address, and specialization, which will be saved to the doctor.txt file.
	5.	View Doctor List:
	•	The program retrieves and displays the details of all added doctors from the doctor.txt file.
